    "```python\n",
    "from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Parameters of ImageDataGenerator\n",
    "\n",
    "    featurewise_center:\n",
    "        Type: bool\n",
    "        Default: False\n",
    "        Description: If set to True, it will center the data by subtracting the mean of the dataset. This helps in normalizing the input.\n",
    "        Importance: Useful for ensuring that the data has a mean of zero, which can improve convergence during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    featurewise_std_normalization:\n",
    "        Type: bool\n",
    "        Default: False\n",
    "        Description: If True, it divides the data by the standard deviation of the dataset.\n",
    "        Importance: This further normalizes the data, making it more suitable for training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "    rescale:\n",
    "        Type: float\n",
    "        Default: None\n",

    "        Importance: Ensures that input values are in a suitable range for training, which can lead to better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    zca_whitening:\n",
    "        Type: bool\n",
    "        Default: False\n",
    "        Description: If True, applies ZCA whitening to the data.\n",

    "        Default: False\n",
    "        Description: Randomly flip inputs horizontally.\n",

    "\n",
    "    vertical_flip:\n",
    "        Type: bool\n",
    "        Default: False\n",
    "        Description: Randomly flip inputs vertically.\n",

    "\n",
    "    fill_mode:\n",
    "        Type: str\n",
    "        Default: 'nearest'\n",
